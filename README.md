# gauss_error_function_erf
Scripts that use the definition and approximations of the Gaussian Error Function, otherwise known as erf(x).
## Fastest Script
gauss_error_pade.py is the more accurate script for inputs near 0, but for higher values, I recommend using the definition, gauss_error_integration.py.
